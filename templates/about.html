        <p class="value-proposition__text text text--small text--regular text-white" style="font-size: 22px;">A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that is protected by encryption, making counterfeiting and double-spending practically impossible. Many cryptocurrency are built on blockchain technology, which is a blockchain platform enforced by a distributed network of computers. Cryptocurrencies are distinguished by the fact that they are not issued by any central authority, making them potentially impervious to government intervention or manipulation.</p>

        <h1 class="value-proposition__title text-white" style="font-size: 48px;">How Does Cryptocurrency Work?</h1><hr style="border-top: 1px solid white;"><br>
      <br>
        <p class="value-proposition__text text text--small text--regular text-white" style="font-size: 22px;">A cryptocurrency is a digital, encrypted, and distributed medium of exchange. There is no central body that manages and maintains the value of a cryptocurrency, unlike the US dollar or the Euro. Instead, these tasks are distributed all across internet among the users of a cryptocurrency.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="value-proposition__text text text--small text--regular text-white" style="font-size: 22px;">Although most individuals invest in cryptocurrencies as they would in other assets such as stocks or precious metals, you may use crypto to buy conventional goods and services. While cryptocurrency is a fresh and interesting asset class, investing in it can be risky because you must conduct extensive research to properly understand how each system operates.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="value-proposition__text text text--small text--regular text-white" style="font-size: 22px;">Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency, first outlined in principle by Satoshi Nakamoto in a 2008 paper titled <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">“Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.”</a> Nakamoto described the project as “an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust.”</p>
        <br>
        <p class="value-proposition__text text text--small text--regular text-white" style="font-size: 22px;">This cryptographic proof is provided in the form of transactions that are validated and recorded on the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/what-is-blockchain/">“blockchain.”</a></p>



        <h1 class="value-proposition__title text-white" style="font-size: 48px;">Bitcoin</h1><hr style="border-top: 1px solid white;"><br>

        <br>
        <p class="value-proposition__text text text--small text--regular text-white" style="font-size: 22px;">Bitcoin virtual currency that was first introduced in January of 2009. It is based on ideas presented in a white paper by Satoshi Nakamoto, a mysterious and pseudonymous figure. 12 The identity of the individual or people behind the technology is still unknown. Bitcoin promises reduced transaction fees than existing online payment methods, and it is run by a decentralised authority, unlike government-issued currencies.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="value-proposition__text text text--small text--regular text-white" style="font-size: 22px;">Bitcoin is classified as a cryptocurrency since it is protected by encryption. There are no real bitcoins; instead, balances are recorded on a public ledger that anyone can see . A large amount of computational power is used to verify all Bitcoin transactions, a process known as "mining." Bitcoin is not issued or backed by any banks or governments, and a single bitcoin has no monetary value. Despite the fact that Bitcoin is not legal cash in most parts of the globe, it is extremely popular and has sparked the creation of hundreds of rival cryptocurrencies known as altcoins. When Bitcoin is exchanged, it is typically abbreviated as BTC.</p>


        <h1 class="value-proposition__title text-white" style="font-size: 48px;">Binance Coin (BNB)</h1><hr style="border-top: 1px solid white;"><br>

        <br>
        <p class="value-proposition__text text text--small text--regular text-white" style="font-size: 22px;">Binance Coin is a cryptocurrency that was created by the Binance exchange and is exchanged under the symbol BNB. Binance Exchange is the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange since about June 2021, with over 1.4 million transactions per second.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="value-proposition__text text text--small text--regular text-white" style="font-size: 22px;">Binance Coin is a cryptocurrency that was created by the Binance exchange and is traded under the symbol BNB.BNB is the native currency of Binance's own blockchain, the Binance chain, and was originally based on the Ethereum network.
          Binance spends one-fifth of its revenues every quarter to repurchase and permanently destroy Binance tokens held in its treasury, a process known as "burning."</p>
        <br>
        <p class="value-proposition__text text text--small text--regular text-white" style="font-size: 22px;">Binance started off as a utility token for lower trading fees, but it's now used for a variety of things, including transaction fees (on the Binance Chain), travel bookings, entertainment, online services, and financial services.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="value-proposition__text text text--small text--regular text-white" style="font-size: 22px;">Binance had a market cap of more over $56 billion at the time of writing, placing it behind behind Bitcoin, Ethereum, and USD Tether in terms of market capitalization.</p>

        
        <h1 class="value-proposition__title text-white" style="font-size: 48px;">Ether (ETH)</h1><hr style="border-top: 1px solid white;"><br>

        <br>
        <p class="value-proposition__text text text--small text--regular text-white" style="font-size: 22px;">Ether is a transactional token used on the Ethereum network to make transactions more secure. All of the Ethereum network's programmes and services necessitate computational power (and that computing power is not free). Ether is a cryptocurrency that network participants use to pay for the network to perform their required tasks.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="value-proposition__text text text--small text--regular text-white" style="font-size: 22px;">While ether can be considered the Ethereum network's cryptocurrency, it is more correct to refer to it as the network's "fuel" metaphorically speaking. All network transactions are tracked and facilitated by Ether. This approach differs significantly from how a traditional cryptocurrency works. However, ether has several characteristics with other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.</p>


        <h1 class="value-proposition__title text-white" style="font-size: 48px;">Litecoin (LTC)</h1><hr style="border-top: 1px solid white;"><br>

        <br>
        <p class="value-proposition__text text text--small text--regular text-white" style="font-size: 22px;">Litecoin (LTC) is a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cryptocurrency.asp">“cryptocurrency”</a> created by a former Google developer named Charlie Lee in 2011, two years after Bitcoin. Litecoin, like Bitcoin, is based on an open-source global payment network that is independent of any central authority. <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/042015/bitcoin-vs-litecoin-whats-difference.asp">“Litecoin varies from Bitcoin”</a> in several ways, including the use of Scrypt as a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-work.asp">"proof-of-work (PoW)"</a> algorithm and a quicker block generation rate.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="value-proposition__text text text--small text--regular text-white" style="font-size: 22px;">It is one of the first cryptocurrencies to be created using Bitcoin's original open source code.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="value-proposition__text text text--small text--regular text-white" style="font-size: 22px;">It was at first a serious challenger to Bitcoin. Litecoin's popularity has declined as the cryptocurrency market has gotten considerably more saturated and competitive in recent years with new offerings.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="value-proposition__text text text--small text--regular text-white" style="font-size: 22px;">Litecoin has long been seen as a counter-measure to Bitcoin. In fact, Lee dubbed Litecoin the "lite version of Bitcoin" when he first unveiled it on a popular Bitcoin forum. As a result, Litecoin shares many of Bitcoin's features while also modifying and tweaking those parts that the development team felt should be improved.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="value-proposition__text text text--small text--regular text-white" style="font-size: 22px;">LTC (one Litecoin) is worth roughly $215 as of November 2021, making it the 14th-largest cryptocurrency with a market capitalization of little under $15 billion.</p>

        <h1 class="value-proposition__title text-white" style="font-size: 48px;">NEO</h1><hr style="border-top: 1px solid white;"><br>

        <br>
        <p class="value-proposition__text text text--small text--regular text-white" style="font-size: 22px;">Da Hongfei and Erik Zhan launched NEO as AntShares in China in 2014, and it was rebranded as NEO in June 2017. It's a blockchain-based platform with its own coin and the ability to create digital assets and smart contracts. It is similar to the Ethereum blockchain network, which is situated in the United States.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="value-proposition__text text text--small text--regular text-white" style="font-size: 22px;">NEO seeks to leverage smart contracts to automate the management of digital assets, with the ultimate goal of creating a distributed network-based smart economy system.</p>
